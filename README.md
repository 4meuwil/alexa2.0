# Alexa 2.0

This project requires ***Node Red*** and the ***"Alexa as a media player"*** script by Keaton Taylor successfully running....
Keaton's Github..... https://github.com/keatontaylor
Direct Link to Script... https://github.com/keatontaylor/custom_components/blob/master/media_player/alexa.py

alexa.py should be saved to your config/custom_components/media_player folder

Note: You may have to try a couple times to get the Captcha to work...just enter a few random letters and submit for a fresh photo.

**A Special Thank You! to Keaton Taylor for this amazing script, without it none of this would be possible.**
